# Prometheus Service

This directory contains the configuration for Prometheus, an open-source monitoring system with a time series database.

## Overview

Prometheus is used to collect and store metrics from the application's services (e.g., backend, Traefik). It provides a powerful query language (PromQL) for analyzing these metrics.

## Technologies Used

*   **Prometheus**: Monitoring system and time series database.

## Configuration

*   `prometheus.yml`: The main configuration file for Prometheus, defining scrape targets (where to collect metrics from) and alerting rules.

## Integration with Architecture

*   **Dockerized**: Prometheus runs as a Docker container.
*   **Docker Compose**: Orchestrated by `docker-compose.yml`.
*   **Backend**: Scrapes metrics from the Spring Boot backend's Actuator endpoints.
*   **Traefik**: Scrapes metrics from Traefik for insights into API Gateway performance.
*   **Grafana**: Prometheus is configured as a data source in Grafana for visualization.
*   **Access Endpoint**: `http://localhost:9090`
    *   **What you'll find**: The Prometheus UI for querying metrics (using PromQL), viewing targets, and checking the status of your monitoring setup.

## Professional Considerations

*   **Alerting**: Can be integrated with Alertmanager for sophisticated alerting based on metric thresholds.
*   **High Availability**: For production, consider running Prometheus in a highly available setup with replication and federation.
*   **Long-Term Storage**: For long-term metric storage, integrate with remote storage solutions (e.g., Thanos, Cortex).
*   **Scraping Configuration**: Ensure all relevant services and their instances are properly configured as scrape targets.
